## saneciv - startup nation civilization

This is is the classic civilization kit, also know as big ball of
micro-services mud.  It includes, but is not limited to the following
softwares:

- [wikimedia](https://github.com/wikimedia)
- [wikidata](https://github.com/Wikidata)
- [ElasticSearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch)
- [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/postgres/postgres) or [MySQL](https://github.com/mysql) or [MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo)
- [mastodon](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/) or [plemora](https://pleroma.social/)

Obviously the above is not enough.  In particular, it does not offer
anything related to
[e-governance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-governance), also it
does not provide tools to ease law making process, sustain production
chain of food, medecine, culture, *et al*.

Among other things, it is not [bootstrappable](http://bootstrappable.org/).

As is this is not ready-made solution for a sustainable civilization.
